//instead of accessing properties from object using obj[prop] we can make use of Reflect.get(obj,prop) or Reflect.set(obj, prop, value)
//Tradeoffs
// Proxies are a powerful way to add control over the behavior of an object. A proxy can have various use-cases: it can help with validation, formatting, notifications, or debugging.

// Overusing the Proxy object or performing heavy operations on each handler method invocation can easily affect the performance of your application negatively. Itâ€™s best to not use proxies for performance-critical code.
